# WS22 Companion PCBA

## Introduction
This circuit board pairs with the Wavesculptor 22 to wrap its electrical interface and soften some rough edges around the OEM hardware. It is meant to pair with an additional enclosure to better seal and cool the motor controller.

## Current functionality
* Adds substantial DC bus capacitance to reduce voltage ripple.
* Adds capacitance from the DC bus to the chassis to mitigate charge injection.
* Adds a fan controller for thermal management.

## Potential functionality
* Provide multiple simultaneous options for rotor position sensing.
* Provide additional protection for motor position and temperature nets.
* Provide new remote control or diagnostic mechanisms.

## Changes 1.0.0 --> 1.1.0
* None yet
